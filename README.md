# Financial Modeling & Equity Valuation (DCF & Relative Valuation)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **full-scale financial modeling and equity valuation framework** developed as part of an **MSc Finance Corporate Finance module**.

The analysis applies **intrinsic valuation using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) based on Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)** and **relative valuation using Price-to-Book (P/B) multiples**, which are particularly relevant for banking and financial institutions.

The project showcases practical skills in **financial forecasting, valuation modeling, sensitivity analysis, and investment recommendation formulation** using a real-world listed company as a case study.

## Valuation Framework

### 1. Financial Statement Forecasting
- Forecasted Income Statement components from FY26–FY30
- Key drivers: revenue growth, operating leverage, cost efficiency, asset quality, and credit costs
- Assumptions grounded in macroeconomic trends and sector dynamics

---

### 2. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) – FCFE Model
- Valuation based on **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE)**, suitable for banks
- **Cost of Equity (WACC):** 10.75% (derived using CAPM)
- **Terminal Growth Rate:** 5.0%
- Present value of explicit forecast cash flows and terminal value estimated
- Sensitivity analysis performed on discount rate and terminal growth assumptions

---

### 3. Relative Valuation (Multiples-Based)
- Peer comparison using **Price-to-Book (P/B)** multiples
- Peer median multiple applied to estimated book value per share
- Cross-validation of intrinsic value with market-based valuation metrics

---

### 4. Blended Valuation & Investment View
- Combined intrinsic (DCF) and relative (P/B) valuation
- Weighted approach reflecting valuation practices used in banking equity research
- Final investment recommendation derived from blended fair value versus market price

---

## Key Outputs
